/*
 * These routines do some reordering of the supplied data before
 * calling engine() to do the main work.
 *
 * The reordering seems similar to that done by the initial stages of
 * the DES algorithm, in that it looks like it's just been done to
 * try and make software decoding slower.  I'm not sure that it
 * actually adds anything to the security.
 *
 * The nature of the shuffling is that the bits of the supplied
 * parameter 'varient' are reorganised (and some inverted),  and
 * the bytes of the parameter 'challenge' are reorganised.
 *
 * The reorganisation in each routine is different,  and the first
 * (CryptKey1) does not bother of play with the 'varient' parameter.
 *
 * Since this code is only run once per disk change,  I've made the
 * code table driven in order to improve readability.
 *
 * Since these routines are so similar to each other,  one could even
 * abstract them all to one routine supplied a parameter determining
 * the nature of the reordering it has to do.
